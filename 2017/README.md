# Advent of Code 2017 in OCaml

This repo contains my (ongoing) solutions to the Advent of Code 2017 problems. I’m using it as a way to become more
familiar with OCaml, which I’ve only been learning for a couple weeks now, so I make no claims on the quality of the
solutions or how idiomatic they are for OCaml.


## Requirements

  - OCaml 4.06
  - Core v0.10.0
  - Batteries 2.8.0

All of these can be installed with opam.


## Instructions

To build any of the files, run make with the basename of the source file. For example, to build `day3_spiral2.ml`, run

    make day3_spiral2

This will produce a binary named `day3_spiral2.native` that you can execute.

All code is licensed under the MIT license. Do with it as you will.
