# Advent of Code in OCaml

This repo contains my solutions to problems from [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com) in
[OCaml](https://ocaml.org).

Iâ€™m using this project to play with and learn OCaml, so no code in this repo should be taken as good
or idiomatic OCaml.

All code in this repo is licensed under the MIT license, so feel free to do with it as you will.
